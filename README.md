Great python script for splitting bills with Housemates. Especially on Costco runs! :D

**why**

When you shop with your housemates and one person pays for everything, it is such a hassle to go through each item on the list and ask e.g. who wants to drink the orange juice. If you enter an 'x' in the given your box on your spreadsheet that excludes you from the item. It then goes through everyone who doesn't have an x and splits the bill evenly. Check groceries.xls for a sample.

**How to run script**
Linux and Mac terminal:

python NewGroceries.py yourSpreadsheet.xls 

**or**

chmod u+x NewGroceries.py

./NewGroceries.py yourSpreadsheet.xls

**How to use**

Follow the format in the sample spreadsheet in *groceries.xls*.
