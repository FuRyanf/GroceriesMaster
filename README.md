# GroceriesMaster

Python script that splits the cost of groceries. When shopping with housemates, it is a hassle to calculate how much each person pays especially if there are people splitting certain groceries e.g. eggs. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Download the python [xlrd module](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xlrd).

Extract file and run setup.py file like: `python setup.py install`

### How to format spreadsheet

Follow the format in `groceries.xls`. 'x' means that you don't want to partake in splitting the corresponding item. Groceries are otherwise split equally.

### Running script

On Terminal:

```bash
python NewGroceries.py yourSpreadsheet.xls 
```
